### Exercise 2.2
Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:

### 1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4 Ï€r3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
```
from math import pi

radius = 5
volume = (4 / 3) * pi * radius**3

print(f"{volume:.2f}")
```

### 2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
```
price = 24.95
copies = 60
price_after_discount = 24.95 - (24.95 * .40)

if copies > 1:
    shipping = 3 + (copies - 1) * .75
    
else:
    shipping = 3

total_price = price_after_discount * copies + shipping
print(f"${total_price:.2f}")
```
$945.45


### 3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
```
# (in seconds after 12:00 am)
time_leave = 6 * 3600 + 52 * 60 

# total running time (in seconds)
running_time = (8 * 60 + 15) * 2

# time in tempo (in seconds)
tempo_time = (7 * 60 + 12) * 3

# Total time after 12:00 am (in seconds)
total_time = time_leave + running_time + tempo_time

print(f"total seconds = {total_time} seconds")

hh = total_time // 3600
mm = (total_time - (hh * 3600)) // 60
ss = total_time  - (hh * 3600 + mm * 60)

print(f"get home at {hh}:{mm}:{ss} am")
```
total seconds = 27006 seconds  
get home at 7:30:6 am
