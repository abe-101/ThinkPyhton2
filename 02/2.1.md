### Exercise 2.1

Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn a new feature,
you should try it out in interactive mode and make errors on purpose to see what goes wrong.

### • We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?

42 is a literal and we cannot assign to a literal.
```
>>> 42 = n
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    42 = n
    ^
SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
```

### • How about x = y = 1?

It's legal, both x and y will be assigned 1
```
>>> x = y = 1
>>> x
1
>>> y
1
>>> 
```

### • In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?

Nothing.

### • What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
Invalid syntax. unless it is after a integer then it will treat it like a float.
```
>>> x = 1.
>>> x
1.0
>>> y = x.
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    y = x.
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

### • In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?
It's illegal
```
>>> x = 1
>>> x
1
>>> y = 2
>>> xy.
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    xy.
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
