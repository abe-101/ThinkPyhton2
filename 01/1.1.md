### Exercise 1.1

### 1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

If the right parentheses is omitted, the interpreter continues onto the next line waiting for the closing parentheses.  
But if the left parentheses is missing or if both are missing, the interpreter suggests a correction.

```
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'Hello, World!'
          ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('Hello, World!')?
```

  
### 2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?


The interpiter reports a `Syntac Error: invalid syntax`. 


### 3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plussign before a number? What about 2++2?



It is treated like a positive number.
```
>>> 2++2
4
```

### 4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 09. What happens if you try this in Python?
What about 011?


Leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted.
```
>>> 01 + 1
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    01 + 1
     ^
SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted; use an 0o prefix for octal integers
```
