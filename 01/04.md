### Chapter 2 Exercise 4

In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 09. What happens if you try this in Python?
What about 011?

### Solution

Leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted.
```
>>> 01 + 1
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    01 + 1
     ^
SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted; use an 0o prefix for octal integers
```
