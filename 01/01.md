### Chapter 2 Exercise 1

In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

### Solution

If the right parentheses is omitted, the interpreter continues onto the next line waiting for the closing parentheses.  
But if the left parentheses is missing or if both are missing, the interpreter suggests a correction.

```
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print 'Hello, World!'
          ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('Hello, World!')?
```
